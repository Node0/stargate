# 🚀 Stargate: Privacy-First Real-Time Collaboration Platform

> **Your data stays yours. Your network, your control.**

Stargate is a self-hosted, real-time collaboration platform that keeps your sensitive information exactly where it belongs—on your own infrastructure. Whether you're a family sharing memories, a development team iterating on code, or a research group collaborating on sensitive data, Stargate provides enterprise-grade collaboration without the privacy compromises.

## 🏠 **Perfect for Families**

### Private File Sharing That Actually Stays Private
- **🔒 Zero Cloud Dependencies**: Share family photos, videos, and documents without uploading to Google Drive, Dropbox, or any external service
- **📱 Cross-Device Sync**: Access your files from any device on your home network—phones, tablets, laptops, smart TVs
- **⚡ Instant Transfer**: Move large video files (GBs) between family devices in seconds, not hours
- **🎯 Smart Organization**: Time-indexed search means finding "that video from Sarah's birthday last month" takes seconds, not scrolling through endless chat histories

### Real-Time Family Communication
- **👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Shared Spaces**: Create dedicated "registers" for different family activities—vacation planning, grocery lists, homework schedules
- **🔄 Live Updates**: See changes as they happen—no more "did you see my message?" confusion
- **📅 Timeline Scrubbing**: Jump back to any point in your family's collaboration history—recover deleted notes, see how plans evolved

**Use Cases:**
- Planning family vacations with real-time itinerary collaboration
- Sharing large video files from school events without cloud storage costs
- Creating shared shopping lists that update instantly
- Coordinating schedules across multiple family members
